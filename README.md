# Boulou_Service
The main objective of this project is to design and develop a Vehicle Marketplace (Android and iOS) that will help customers/vehicle owners to register them on the platform and can further add their vehicle details. Customers will be able to add all the details of their vehicles and further they can find nearby vehicle service provider like Auto Repair, Oil Change, Car Wash, Gasoline, Diesel, Pick and Drop etc. Customers will be able to get the recommendations based on the vehicle service details added by them. Customer can book vehicle service provider for their service and once booking is marked as completed by vehicle service provider customer need to pay them for their work.
